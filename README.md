# Elian Temes - Full-stack Developer
I am a passionate software developer with a strong focus on theory, system design principles, clean code, and a keen interest in technology in general and science. I am always eager to take on new challenges with a strong focus on teamwork and excellent social skills. I am a cheerful and energetic individual with a lot of potential for growth.

Currently, I have a year and a half of experience as a Full-stack Developer working now for Vittal Socorro Medico Privado S.A.

## Professional Experience
One of my most rewarding experiences at my previous job was leading the development of nearly 5/6 of the functionalities for a project called Plata Madre. This project helped a jewelry company with multiple stores keep track and manage materials, stocks, sales, employees, payments, and much more.

Another great experience I recently had was at Vittal, with hard work and a lot of research, I made a great improvement on the speed of a billing system that was taking 6 hours to complete the processing of approximately 6000 bills. By implementing the .Net implementation of multithreading and testing it thoroughly, the process ended up needing only 26 minutes to fully complete, an improvement of almost 530%. This was great because the same solution can be applied to other systems in the company, and it made me very happy to know that I was helping a lot with the research I made.

## Skills and Expertise
In addition to my professional experience, I have a strong academic background and personal interest in a wide range of technologies. I'm particularly proud of my understanding of fundamental concepts in software development and programming. I also tend to read a lot about software design, architecture principles, design patterns, etc., just for fun and to improve myself as a developer.
